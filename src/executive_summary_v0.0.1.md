# **SHOULD GOVERNMENT, THROUGH AN ACT OF CONGRESS, MANDATE BUILDING PROFESSIONALS TO DESIGN, BUILD AND OPERATE GREEN BUILDINGS?**

# Executive Summary

Balangkasan, is the discussion forum for emerging issues that affect the practice of architecture in the Philippines.  It was established in 1989, by United Architects of the Philippines Manila Maharlika Chapter Past President Arch. Diogenes “Ging” A. Barredo. It was first held at the Club Filipino in San Juan City.  Mechanics of the Balangkasan was further revised and improved by UAP Manila Maharlika Past President Arch. Fernando “Fred” L. Jurilla.
27 Years after the original Balangkasan was first held, Balangkasan 2016, shall be hosted by the initiators of the forum — UAP Manila Maharlika Chapter.  

Balangkasan 2016 shall be held with a new format, an informal and loose adaption of the Oxford-style debate format to stimulate orderly and informed debate on the motion — *Should the Government, through an Act of Congress, Mandate Building Professionals to Design, Build and Operate Green Buildings?*

On 19 February 1977, Presidential Decree No. 1096, otherwise known as the National Building Code of the Philippines was promulgated, mandating the design, build and operation of safe and environmentally sound buildings.  The power to formulate and implement policies, plans, standards and guidelines in accordance with the decree was vested on the then Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communications.  In 1984, the first set of rules and regulations to implement the decree was issued. In the years succeeding, only two (2) major revisions were issued.  In all rules and regulations issued, the environmental dimension of building design, construction and operation was not made part of the scope.
On 22 June 2015, the Department of Public Works and Highways issued the National Green Building Code as a Referral Code.  This Code was developed under the direction of the DPWH Secretary with coordination and support from Philippine building professionals.  The mandate to implement of this Code is not absolute and is limited only to projects with a gross floor area of 20,000 square meters.     

At present, without question and doubt, there is consensus among building professionals that the plethora of negative environmental impacts that buildings create demands that environmental protection and conservation must be central to the way buildings are designed, constructed and operated.  However, the issue whether or not green building should be a mandate for building professionals exists.
